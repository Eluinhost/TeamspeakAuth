TS3 Authentication for Minecraft Accounts
=========================================

This provides a way to verify a Minecraft account belongs to a user within Teamspeak. On successful verification the
user will be provided a server group of choice, will have their description set to their Minecraft username and will
have an icon assigned to them that is the same as their ingame skin.

How it works
------------

There are 2 parts to the verification, a website and a fake minecraft server. First the user must visit the website and
type in their current Teamspeak username and click the button. It will then send them a code via private message on
Teamspeak that they have to input on the web page. The user must also connect to the fake Minecraft server with a valid
account where they will be kicked immediately with a message containing a code. The user must also input their Minecraft
username and the provided code into the website. If all the data matches the website will then contact the Teamspeak
server and set up the user.

Installation
------------

This project has the following requirements:

- PHP
- MySQL
- Web Server with PHP support
- NodeJS
- Bower
- Composer
- NPM

### Set up dependencies

Download all dependencies by running the following in the root of the project:

`composer install`

`bower install`

`npm install`

The auth server depends on the node module 'ursa' which has the following notes for running on Windows machines:

On Windows, you'll need to install some dependencies first:
 - [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/) (`npm install -g node-gyp`)
   - [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3#download) (not 3.3)
   - Vistual Studio 2010 or higher (including Express editions)
     - Windows XP/Vista/7:
        - Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2010 ([Express](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709949) version works well)
        - For 64-bit builds of node and native modules you will _**also**_ need the [Windows 7 64-bit SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279)
        - If you get errors that the 64-bit compilers are not installed you may also need the [compiler update for the Windows SDK 7.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422)
     - Windows 8:
        - Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 for Windows Desktop ([Express](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9816758) version works well)
 - [OpenSSL](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) (normal, not light)
in the same bitness as your Node.js installation.
  - The build script looks for OpenSSL in the default install directory  
  (`C:\OpenSSL-Win32` or `C:\OpenSSL-Win64`)
  - If you get `Error: The specified module could not be found.`, copy `libeay32.dll` from the OpenSSL bin directory to this module's bin directory, or to Windows\System3.

Personally installing [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) and replacing `npm install` with `npm install --msvs_version=2013` ran from the Visual Studio 'Developer Command Prompt' was enough (OpenSSL and Python still required)

### Set up configuration

Copy the file /config/config.yml.dist to /config/config.yml and edit the parameters to fit your server

    parameters:
      minutesToLast: 15             # Number of minutes codes are valid for
      iconURL: "https://minotar.net/helm/;username;/16.png" # URL to get the faces from, replaces ;username; with the minecraft username
      serverAddress: "auth.publicuhc.com or publicuhc.com:35879" # The address to show on the webpage for the auth server
      teamspeak:
        host: localhost             # The address of the teamspeak server
        port: 9988                  # The port of the server to use
        username: serveradmin       # The username to login with, must have valid permissions to edit descriptions/users e.t.c.
        password: ""                # The password to login with
        query_port: 10011           # The port the teamspeak serverquery is on
        group_id: 222               # The group ID to change people to when authenticated
      database:
        host: localhost             # The address of the database server
        port: 3306                  # The port of the database
        database: authentication            # The database to use
        minecraft_table: minecraft_codes    # The table name for the minecraft codes
        teamspeak_table: teamspeak_codes    # The table name for the teamspeak codes
        username: ""                # The username to login to the database
        password: ""                # The password to use
      minecraft:
        host: localhost             # The address to listen on for the fake server
        port: 35879                 # The port to listen on for the fake server
        motd: "Â§eAuth Server"       # The MOTD to display on the server list

    #  Ignore everything below here unless you know what you are doing #

        class: PublicUHC\TeamspeakAuth\Helpers\DefaultMinecraftHelper
        arguments: ["%iconURL%"]
      teamspeakhelper:

### Set up database

You can use the following snippet to create the default structure.

    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS minecraft_codes;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS teamspeak_codes;
    CREATE TABLE minecraft_codes
    (
      ID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      uuid varchar(128) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      code varchar(10) NOT NULL,
      created_time datetime
    );
    CREATE TABLE teamspeak_codes
    (
      ID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      uuid varchar(128) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      code varchar(10) NOT NULL,
      created_time datetime
    );
    
How to run the fake Minecraft server
------------------------------------

To run the authentication server all you need to do is run authserver/AuthServer.js with node:

`node AuthServer.js`
