You can create/edit your config.yml file by running the command:

`grunt configure`

        port: 3306                  # The port of the database
        database: authentication            # The database to use
        username: ""                # The username to login to the database

        description: "Â§eAuth Server"    # The MOTD to display on the server list

If you edit the file manually either run `grunt clean:container` or delete the folder /cache/container to update the settings
